# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SSH Notify Tool is a universal notification system designed for CLI tools that need to communicate status changes to users across different execution environments. The tool provides a client-server architecture that enables both local and remote notification delivery through multiple channels (desktop notifications, email, SMS), with special focus on supporting SSH-based remote execution scenarios through port forwarding mechanisms.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This tool addresses the critical gap in user experience when running long-running CLI processes, enabling seamless notification delivery regardless of whether the CLI tool is executed locally or remotely via SSH. The tool promotes better workflow efficiency by keeping users informed of important status changes without requiring constant terminal monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CLI tool developer, I want to integrate notification capabilities into my application, so that users receive timely updates on task progress, completion, or failures without having to monitor the terminal continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CLI tool calls the notification client THEN the system SHALL accept notification requests with configurable content (title, message, level, channels)
2. IF the notification request is valid THEN the system SHALL queue the notification for processing without blocking the CLI tool
3. WHEN the notification is processed THEN the system SHALL deliver it through the specified channels (desktop, email, SMS)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user running CLI tools locally, I want to receive desktop notifications on my machine, so that I can stay informed about task status while working in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is sent with desktop channel THEN the system SHALL display a native desktop notification (Windows Toast/macOS Notification Center/Linux notify-send)
2. IF the desktop notification system is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt alternative channels
3. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL respect the notification level (info, warning, error) with appropriate visual styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user running CLI tools on remote servers via SSH, I want to receive notifications on my local machine, so that I can monitor remote processes without maintaining constant SSH connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server component runs locally THEN it SHALL listen on a configurable localhost port for incoming notification requests
2. IF SSH reverse port forwarding is established THEN remote clients SHALL successfully send notifications through the tunnel
3. WHEN a remote notification is received THEN the system SHALL process it identically to local notifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure multiple notification channels (email, SMS), so that I can receive alerts through my preferred communication methods based on urgency level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL send email notifications using SMTP settings
2. IF SMS configuration is enabled THEN the system SHALL send SMS notifications through supported providers (Twilio, Aliyun)
3. WHEN multiple channels are specified THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications to all configured channels asynchronously

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the notification system to use secure authentication mechanisms, so that unauthorized parties cannot send notifications through my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL require authentication tokens for all notification requests
2. IF SSH key authentication is available THEN the system SHALL leverage existing SSH security for remote connections
3. WHEN binding to network interfaces THEN the server SHALL default to localhost-only binding unless explicitly configured otherwise

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure notification settings through a configuration file, so that I can customize behavior for different environments and security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from ~/.notifytool/config.json
2. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL create default configuration with secure defaults
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime reloading without restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to handle failures gracefully, so that my CLI tools continue working even if notifications fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the client SHALL not block or crash the calling CLI tool
2. IF a notification channel is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt other configured channels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate server, client, and notification channel implementations into distinct modules
- **Modular Design**: Plugin-based notification channels for easy extensibility (desktop, email, SMS, future channels)
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies, prefer Node.js built-in modules where possible
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define REST API contracts for client-server communication and plugin interfaces for notification channels

### Performance
- **Response Time**: Notification API calls must complete within 500ms to avoid blocking CLI tools
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All notification delivery must be non-blocking and handled asynchronously
- **Resource Usage**: Server component should consume less than 50MB RAM in idle state
- **Concurrent Requests**: Support at least 100 concurrent notification requests

### Security
- **Authentication**: All API requests must include valid authentication tokens
- **Network Binding**: Default to localhost binding with explicit configuration required for external access
- **SSH Integration**: Support SSH key-based authentication for secure remote tunneling
- **Configuration Security**: Store sensitive configuration (SMTP passwords, API keys) securely
- **Input Validation**: Validate all input parameters to prevent injection attacks

### Reliability
- **High Availability**: Server component should maintain 99.9% uptime during normal operation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operating with reduced functionality if individual channels fail
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Data Persistence**: Optional queuing for notifications when channels are temporarily unavailable

### Usability
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
- **Simple Integration**: CLI tools should require minimal code changes to integrate notifications
- **Configuration Management**: Provide clear documentation and examples for configuration setup
- **SSH Setup**: Include helper scripts or documentation for SSH port forwarding setup
